# Let-s-Take-Attendance
This is specially made for Arjun sir. Who is my best teacher.

This is a small website which solves a big problem faced by our Arjun Sir. "Attendance Problem". So he gave us the project. It doesn't mean that our sir doesn't know anything. Our sir is very talented but he wanted to see our talent. So they did not solve this problem themselves but left it to us.

I am sharing the link below of my very small application to solve a big problem.
